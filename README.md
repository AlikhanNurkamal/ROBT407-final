# ROBT407 Final Project
This repository contains the final project for the course ROBT407 - Machine Learning with Applications.

## Models
In this project, we implemented
1. ResNet (50 and 101) architecture as well as custom CNN model (VGG16-like) to detect distracted drivers from images,
2. ... (RNN model) to classify Quora insincere questions.

## Training
In order to train a model, run the following script
```
python3 train.py --task 1 --model_name resnet50
```
